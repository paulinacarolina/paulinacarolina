Hi there 👋  
I'm Paulina, a Mexican Backend Software Engineer based in Aguascalientes, Mexico 🇲🇽

🔭 With 5+ years of experience, I specialize in building scalable and event-driven systems using **Java (Spring Boot)** and **.NET**.  

☁️ Skilled in microservices architecture, Kafka, Docker, CI/CD, SQL & NoSQL, and cloud platforms like **AWS** and **Azure**.

👩🏾‍💻 Currently focusing on strengthening my expertise in Java to embrace a more language-agnostic backend path.

💸 Passionate about fintech — I've worked with financial institutions and high-performance systems since 2021.
